# A generic GUI framework built on top of Dear ImGui

This is a simple GUI framework built on top of ImGui that is meant to be easy to add options to with the least code needed. It is still very much unfinished, but the foundation has been laid.

Build with meson to test it out. By default, OpenSans-Regular.ttf file has to be put inside the directory so that ImGui can read it and use as a font.
